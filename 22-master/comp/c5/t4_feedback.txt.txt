This project helped me train my skills and knowledge on digital design and some about VHDL code, functionality of different modules and state machines.
However, I find some drawbacks:
1. HDL and Vivado applications crashed some time, and it took a lot of time to generate bit file.
2. Some of the tutorials were not very in details.
